Color is a set of widgets for color management, which needs to be cross
platform and work within the realms of a web component.

Restriction
 a single color+picker widget (like a combobox or buttonedit)
 can't work in a web component as overlay window would be required to
 expand the pulldown for the selector, so the color display and selector
 need to be separate

color_selector
 - run as a widget or in a dialog
 - palatte and/or color wheel + value

color widget
 very simple widget - like edit but shows color and optional color code
  (in hex, rgb, hsv)
 data value = color
 body background = color
 onClick (or dblClick) - send action zoom
